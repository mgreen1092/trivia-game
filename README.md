Challenges and Unsolved Problems:
Creating the timer was the most challenging part of the project given how I had all the functions set up. When I first created the timer, it was in an infinite loop. To resolve this, I created an if, else statement to only allow the timer to decrement if the timer number was greater than or equal to one. I also needed to create a separate function to reset the timer when reesetting the game.
